Easy Banana Bread – No Whipping Required
Ingredients
* Ripe Bananas (peeled) – 200 g – 2 medium (about 1 cup mashed)
* Eggs – 100 g (2) – 2 large
* Granulated Sugar – 100 g – 1/2 cup
* Vegetable Oil (or melted butter) – 80 ml – 1/3 cup
* Milk – 50 ml – 3 tbsp + 1 tsp
* Cake Flour – 200 g – 1 2/3 cup
* Baking Powder – 5 g – 1 tsp
* Baking Soda – 2.5 g – 1/2 tsp
* Salt – 1.5 g – 1/4 tsp
* Vanilla Extract (optional) – 5 ml – 1 tsp

Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Grease or line a loaf pan with parchment paper.
2. Mash bananas with a fork, then add eggs, sugar, oil, milk, and vanilla extract; mix until combined.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Sift into wet mixture and fold gently until no dry flour remains (do not overmix).
4. Pour batter into the pan and tap lightly to release air bubbles.
5. Bake for 45–55 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.
6. Cool before slicing and serving.

?? Tips
* Add chopped walnuts or chocolate chips for extra flavor.
* For muffins, bake 20–25 minutes instead.
* If you don't have cake flour, substitute by replacing 20g of all-purpose flour with 20g cornstarch.
