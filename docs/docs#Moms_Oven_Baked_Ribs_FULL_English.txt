Mom’s Oven-Baked Ribs + Crispy Potato Wedges (Final English Version)
Main Ingredients
* - 1 full slab of pork ribs (~2 lbs), preferably back ribs; side ribs are okay.
* - 4 large sheets of aluminum foil (2 per rib portion).
* - 3–4 medium potatoes, cut into wedges with skin on.
? Dry Rub for Ribs
* Ingredients:
* - 3 tablespoons brown sugar
* - 1 teaspoon black pepper
* - 1 teaspoon paprika (optional)
* - ½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
* - 1 tablespoon salt (or 1 + ¼ tablespoons if not marinating)
* - 3 tablespoons cornmeal (or flour; if using cornstarch, only 2 tablespoons)
* - ½ teaspoon baking powder
* Instructions:
* 1. Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl.
* 2. Pat ribs dry with paper towels.
* 3. Rub the dry mix evenly over both sides of the ribs and massage it in.
* 4. Wrap each rib half with 2 sheets of foil. The second sheet should overlap the first by half. Fold and seal all edges tightly to prevent leaking.
* 5. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. If skipping this step, use 1 + ¼ tablespoons salt.
? Wet Marinade
* Ingredients:
* - 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* - 1 tablespoon vinegar (fruit vinegar or lemon juice + water)
* - 5 tablespoons water
* Instructions:
* 1. Mix the marinade ingredients in a bowl.
* 2. Open a corner of the foil pack and pour in 4–5 tablespoons of the sauce.
* 3. Reseal tightly to keep all moisture inside.
? Bake the Ribs
* - Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
* - Place the sealed foil packs on a baking tray.
* - Bake for about 90 minutes or until the ribs are tender and pull apart easily.
? Gravy Sauce
* 1. Open one corner of the foil pack and pour the juices into a small saucepan.
* 2. Mix 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 1 tablespoon water to make a slurry.
* 3. Add the slurry to the saucepan and heat, stirring constantly, until thickened.
* 4. If the sauce isn’t thick enough, add a bit more cornstarch slurry and reheat.
? Honey Broil Finish
* 1. Fully unwrap the ribs and brush a thin layer of honey over the top.
* 2. Turn on the oven's Broil setting and broil for 3–5 minutes.
* 3. Watch closely to avoid burning. The surface should just caramelize slightly.
Crispy Potato Wedges

* - 3–4 medium potatoes, cut into wedges
* - ½ teaspoon salt (for drawing out moisture)
* - 1 teaspoon salt (for seasoning)

* 4. Spread in a single layer on a baking tray.
* 5. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 40–50 minutes, flipping halfway through.
* 6. Optional: Broil for 3–5 minutes at the end for extra crispiness.
Sour Cream Dipping Sauce (Updated)

* - 4 tablespoons sour cream
* - A few drops of lemon juice (optional)
* - A pinch of salt
